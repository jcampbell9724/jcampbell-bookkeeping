## How Recent Tax Changes Will Impact Your Small Business in 2025

The beginning of 2025 has brought significant tax policy adjustments that will impact small business owners across the country. Following President Trump's return to office, several tax reforms have been implemented that could affect your bottom line. As a small business owner, staying ahead of these changes is crucial for effective financial planning and tax strategy.

### Key Tax Reform Changes for 2025

#### 1. Business Deduction Expansions

The enhanced Section 179 deduction has been increased to $1.25 million for the 2025 tax year, allowing small businesses to deduct the full purchase price of qualifying equipment and software purchased during the tax year. This represents a significant opportunity for businesses looking to invest in new equipment while receiving immediate tax benefits.

Additionally, bonus depreciation, which had been phasing down, has been restored to 100% for qualified business assets placed in service after January 1, 2025. This reversal of the previous phase-out schedule presents a substantial tax-planning opportunity for businesses considering major purchases.

#### 2. Pass-Through Business Deduction Updates

The Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction (Section 199A), which was set to expire after 2025, has been extended and modified. Small business owners operating as sole proprietors, partnerships, or S-corporations can continue to deduct up to 20% of their qualified business income, with some adjustments to income thresholds and eligible industries.

#### 3. Corporate Tax Rate Stability

While there had been discussions about potential increases, the corporate tax rate remains at 21% for 2025, providing stability for incorporated small businesses. However, new minimum tax provisions for larger corporations could affect growing small businesses approaching higher revenue thresholds.

#### 4. Retirement Plan Incentives

New incentives for establishing and maintaining retirement plans have been introduced, including increased tax credits for small businesses that establish new retirement plans and automatic enrollment provisions.

### How These Changes Affect Your Tax Planning Strategy

With these significant changes, small business owners should consider several adjustments to their tax planning approach:

1. **Reassess Capital Expenditures**: With enhanced deduction opportunities, 2025 may be an optimal year to make previously postponed business investments in equipment or technology.

2. **Review Business Structure**: The extension of pass-through deductions might make certain business structures more advantageous than others. Consider whether your current business entity type (sole proprietorship, LLC, S-corp, etc.) still provides optimal tax benefits.

3. **Update Retirement Strategies**: Take advantage of the new retirement plan incentives to both reduce your tax burden and strengthen your personal financial future.

4. **Adjust Estimated Tax Payments**: With these changes affecting your bottom line, you may need to recalculate your estimated quarterly tax payments to avoid underpayment penalties or unnecessary overpayments.

### Why Professional Bookkeeping Matters More Than Ever

In times of tax policy change, having organized, accurate financial records becomes even more crucial. Professional bookkeeping services can help you:

- Track deductible expenses meticulously to maximize available deductions
- Maintain clean financial records that support your tax positions
- Provide data-driven insights into how tax changes specifically impact your business
