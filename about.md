        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <div class="two-column">
            <div class="column">
                <p>Foundation Bookkeeping was founded with a clear mission: to provide small businesses with the high-quality financial services typically available only to larger companies.</p>
                
                <p>After years of working in corporate finance, our founder recognized that many small business owners were struggling with financial management, often juggling bookkeeping alongside their core business operations. This not only consumed valuable time but frequently led to costly mistakes and missed opportunities.</p>
                
                <p>We built Foundation Bookkeeping to bridge this gap, offering comprehensive financial services specifically tailored to the unique needs of small businesses. Our approach combines professional expertise with personalized service, providing our clients with both the accurate financial data and strategic insights they need to make informed business decisions.</p>
                
                <p>Today, we serve clients across various industries, helping them achieve financial clarity, maintain compliance, and position their businesses for sustainable growth.</p>
